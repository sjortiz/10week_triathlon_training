# 📖 Definitions & Zones

🏃 Run (pace-first; HR as a check)  
- Z1 – Recovery / Easy Jog: ≤ 8:50/km (HR ideally <125). Keep smooth form; don’t shuffle.  
- Z2 – Aerobic: 8:20–8:45/km (HR ~125–135). Conversational, steady.  
- Z3 – Tempo: 7:30–8:00/km (HR ~136–150). Controlled focus.  
- Z4 – Threshold: 6:40–7:15/km (HR ~151–164). Hard, sustainable for intervals.  
- Z5 – VO₂: < 6:30/km (HR ≥165). Short surges only.  
- Warm-up (WU): easy jog ≤ 8:50/km + mobility.  
- Cool-down (CD): easy jog ≤ 8:50/km or walk.  
- Progression run: start Z2, finish Z3.  
- Intervals: repeat blocks at Z4 pace with easy jog recoveries.  

🚴 Bike (HR + cadence; HRmax = 180)  
- HR Zones: Z1 100–115 • Z2 116–135 • Z3 136–150 • Z4 151–164 • Z5 165–175.  
- Endurance (Z2): HR 120–130 (based on test), cadence 80–90 rpm, smooth pressure.  
- Tempo (Z3): HR 136–150, cadence 85–90 rpm, blocks of 6–15min.  
- Threshold intervals (Z3–Z4): 3–6min work with equal easy spin.  
- Hills: 2–4min climbs Z4, cadence 65–80 rpm; recover on descent.  
- Spin-ups (cadence drills): light gear → 95–105 rpm for 60–90s, relaxed (Z1–Z2).  
- Single-leg drills: 30–45s each leg (trainer/quiet road) to smooth the stroke.  
- Brick: Bike → Run with ≤5min transition.  

🏊 Swim (starts Week 4; beginner)  
- Water comfort: floating, face-in breathing, exhale in water.  
- 25m repeats: short swims with full recovery; technique > distance.  
- Drills: side-kick (balance/rotation), catch-up (timing), fingertip drag (high elbow), fist (forearm engagement).  
- Sighting: brief forward look every 5–6 strokes (introduced later).  
- Rest guideline: take enough rest to keep stroke quality high (e.g., 20–40s).

# Training Load Progression (Approximate & Safe)
- Pre-Week: ~2.5h total  
- Week 1: ~6h (includes **5K run on Saturday**, brick shifted to Sunday)  
- Week 2: ~6.5h (+8%) → Week 3: ~7h (+7%)  
- **Week 4: down/technique week ~6h** (swim begins)  
- Week 5: ~7.5h → Week 6: ~8h → Week 7 (peak): ~8–8.5h  
- **Week 8: consolidation ~6h**  
- Week 9: ~7h  
- **Week 10: race week 4–5h (taper)**  
High-intensity (Z4–Z5) appears **1–2×/week max**, never on consecutive days.

You are my triathlon training assistant.  
I am training for a **Sprint Triathlon on Dec 5**.  

**Goals:**  
- Finish strong.  
- Build fitness toward a half-marathon benchmark (~21K in 1h35).  

**Rules for the plan:**  
- Plan is **10 weeks, Monday → Sunday**, with a **Pre-Week** starting on Sunday before Week 1.  
- **Swim starts on Week 4** (beginner).  
- Include **1 brick per week**.  
- Long bike is **always Thursday**.  
- Gym is **Tuesday (lower/core)** and **Friday (upper/mobility)**.  
- Use **pace as the primary cue for runs** (HR as a secondary check).  
- Use **HR + cadence for bike**.  
- Volume must progress safely (no spikes >8%).  
- High intensity (Z4–Z5) appears max 1–2x/week, never on consecutive days.  
- **Special case Week 1:** Saturday is a **formal 5K race (~35min, controlled)**.  
  - No structured WU/CD (ease into pace during first km).  
  - **Target pace:** ~7:00/km → ~35:00 finish.  
  - **Pacing strategy:**  
    - Km 1: 7:15–7:20/km, settle in.  
    - Km 2–3: ~7:00/km steady.  
    - Km 4: 6:50–6:55/km if feeling good.  
    - Km 5: 6:45–6:50/km if energy allows.  
  - Brick session is moved to **Sunday** instead.
