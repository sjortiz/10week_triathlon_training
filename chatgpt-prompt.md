# Prompt

You are my triathlon training assistant.  
I am training for a **Sprint Triathlon on Dec 5**.  

**Goals:**  
- Finish strong.  
- Build fitness toward a half-marathon benchmark (~21K in 1h35).  

**Rules for the plan:**  
- Plan is **10 weeks, Monday â†’ Sunday**, with a **Pre-Week** starting on Sunday before Week 1.  
- **Swim starts on Week 4** (beginner).  
- Include **1 brick per week**.  
- Long bike is **always Thursday**.  
- Gym is **Tuesday (lower/core)** and **Friday (upper/mobility)**.  
- Use **pace as the primary cue for runs** (HR as a secondary check).  
- Use **HR + cadence for bike**.  
- Volume must progress safely (no spikes >8%).  
- High intensity (Z4â€“Z5) appears max 1â€“2x/week, never on consecutive days.  
- **Special case Week 1:** Saturday is a **formal 5K race (~35min, controlled)**.  
  - No structured WU/CD (ease into pace during first km).  
  - **Target pace:** ~7:00/km â†’ ~35:00 finish.  
  - **Pacing strategy:**  
    - Km 1: 7:15â€“7:20/km, settle in.  
    - Km 2â€“3: ~7:00/km steady.  
    - Km 4: 6:50â€“6:55/km if feeling good.  
    - Km 5: 6:45â€“6:50/km if energy allows.  
  - Brick session is moved to **Sunday** instead.  

**Output format (Markdown only, must be consistent with PDF-ready formatting):**

# Training plan  
For each week (Pre-Week â†’ Week 10):  
- Use `## Week X (Mon MMM DD â€“ Sun MMM DD)` (include the actual **calendar dates**).  
- Pre-Week must also follow the same `## Pre-Week (Sun MMM DD â€“ Mon MMM DD)` style.  
- Add **Weekly Focus** (1â€“2 lines).  
- Add **Why it matters** (1â€“2 lines).  
- Each day listed as `### Day (MMM DD) â€” Workout` (include date for every day).  
- Each workout broken into:  
  - **WU:** (warm-up details)  
  - **Main:** (main set, with paces/HR zones/cadence)  
  - **CD:** (cool-down).  
- Brick sessions written as Bike â†’ Run with **transition â‰¤5min**.  
- Gym included with exercises & sets/reps.

**Important:**  
- Write the entire plan in this exact format.  
- Every week must have **dates in the header** and **dates for each day**.  
- Pre-Week formatting must match the style of regular weeks.  
- Use Markdown headers/bold exactly as described.  
- Do not add explanations, only the structured Markdown plan.
